How to Parse Command Line Output Effectively. 

You can use sed to collapse all the whitespaces into a single space, making it compatible with "cut"
cat acquisitionASNs.txt | sed 's/\s\s*/ /g' | cut -d' ' -f 2

  -an example would be trying to make "ps" output compatible with "cut -d" 

You can get the 2nd to last field of any output.
  hello.subdomain.com
  swag.swag2.subdomain.com
if you want subdomain.com:
cat whois.txt | rev | cut -d '.' -f 2 | rev > domains1.txt

Grep for a phrase, find all the line numbers missing that phrase, create a new line for each line missing that prhase

  this script will check the number at the beginning of the line. so the data has to be formatted as follows:
    1 data
    2 bao;t
    3 scrubdata
    4 testdata
    8 hello
  as you can see there is a gap between 4 and 8. it will fill in the gaps for you so that it does this:
    4 testdata
    5 nodata
    6 nodata
    7 nodata
    8 hello

Search and replace colon with space
sed 's/:/ /g' /etc/passwd
